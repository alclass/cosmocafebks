A History of the Big Bang as a Scientific Achievement

There is one initial statement I should pronounce right at the beginning of this book, ie, I, as I think it should also be the case with most scientists into Cosmology and advanced Astrophysics, cannot atest the truth of such a thesis as to that which we call the Big Bang Hipothesis or, as it is more widely known, the Big Bang Theory, expresssion meaning a very beautiful kind of knowledge, if we're allowed to state it that way, concerning a remote moment in time when the Universe as we have it today began.

I also must inform the reader that this book is not a theoretical textbook in Physics about the whole subject of the Big Bang, aiming to describe the very intricacies of such a profound field of study. Thus saying, this book has a different purpose, it tries to focus into how we get where we got to, how ideas and intellectual formulations shaped and paved the way to such important and unaminous theory about the evolution of the Universe.  Yes, okay, it's not the only one that proposes a world existence, that's true, and I will also try to give some perspective on other options, though some of them will fit in more in a historical context than a disputed antigonised theory.

There is also another disclaimer I would like the reader to be acquainted with before hand: I have a foot in a deep interest in knowing how knowledge is and can be known.  This area of study is generally known as Philosophy of Science in its broader aspect, though this book is not exactly a book in Philosophy of Science in its strict sense. The motivation I had to write this book comes from that feeling, from the inklings and inclinations that connect to a curiosity of our origins.

This brings some words to other more philosophically religious aspects of creational myths. Thus remembered, this book should not look to disputes on the subject in religious grounds, though I somehow feel connections in religious traditions to the larger Big Bang body of knowledge. I hope the discussions that will come up here will be as light as possible, without any intentions to either exhaust it or confer it in favor of one regilion or another.

I still owe a word to the reader who is still assessing whether this book is worth reading or not. To that mission, I'll refer to an example. Suppose someone goes to a talk on the Big Bang subject. Suppose also that the lecturer says, quotes: "we have evidence that the Universe started 13.6 billion years ago in such and such conditions, it then expanded under a super-inflation phase and then formed the Universe as we have it today which is also, as new discoveries have shown, acceleratedly expanding". The example closes with the person attending the talk wondering about how all that might have been possible, in grasping and understanding, and, perhaps in a minor challenge, how all that might be, in a different direction, if at all, refuted.

Of course, this book does not focus on refuting the Big Bang either, though we must accept one very particular deep fact about our doubts, incertainties and perceived mysteries that science can in paralel tell us.  It will also be tried, though not too deeply we hope it, to inquire about our vocations and objetives, if any can be thought of, in this plane of existence. Or, if that's not possible at possible, to wonder whether or not a Big Bang connection might somehow reconnect us to a kind of aspiring mission for humanity.
