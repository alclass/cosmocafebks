== In the age of incredible astro-observational satellites: Kepler and Spitzer

In the previous post, we introduced the subject mentioning that astrophysicists wanted to probe deeper into space, reading the signals from as much of all ranges as they could from all bands in the electromagnetic spectrum.

Today, we bring two major engineering feats that have raised up the standards of how we study the Universe out there. However, the idea layed down before, that of extending the outer space reading spectrum, will still be further explored in future posts. Spitzer in fact was a wonderful advancemment in the infrared side of the electromagnetic spectrum, but other important space telescope projects do deserve our attention for coming articles.

Let's start with Kepler. Kepler looks into space in the visible range of the spectrum, just as Hubble does. Kepler has a very different and focused -- and special -- purpose than Hubble's. Kepler is -- if the analogy is allowed -- a watch dog. Kepler is committed to continuously look at a pre-determined area of the sky -- and look nowhere else. Kepler, in a nutshell, looks for exoplanets, though it does it towards an area that was specially designated by the project's researchers.

Exoplanets are the term we use today to refer to planets outside our own solar system. For decades scientist dreamt of this coming of age, and it came.  Carl Sagan himself explores this in his critically acclaimed TV series Cosmos, back in the late 1970's, a possibility that was envisioned and hope for some relative distant future thence. Unfortunately, Sagan died a little before the first exoplanet was claimed to be found. In fact, hundreds to thousands of exoplanets have been found and catalogued and Kepler alone is responsible for most of them.  Kepler is special in that sense, it's an exoplanet very peculiar searcher.

To find an exoplanet is tricky business. We'll write about the two main techniques in a future post, but very briefly one way of finding an exoplanet is to search for variations of a star's incoming light during its exoplanet edge-on orbital transit. That is, if the exoplanet's transit line orbit is frontal to us against the star position (see illustration below) and as the exoplanet transits that line, it generates machine-sensitive changes of the star's spectral signal, then a planet is thought of to exist at that orbit. This is the transit orbit transit technique.  We'll come back to Kepler's mission in a following post, for we still have other interesting details to tell about it.

Let's then take a brief detour and look at Spitzer, the second astro-observational space telescope we reserved for this post.

Spitzer has a coincidental characteristic to Kepler's. That is why they have come together in this post. They both do not orbit the Earth as satellites, the two, though differently, orbit the Sun, just as Earth itself does. That's alread in itself a feat, for launching those kinds of probes are a lot more difficult in the astronautic sense than launching Earth-orbit satellites, such as Hubble the Space Telescope, these much easier to engineer comparatively speaking.

The illustration below gives a hint of how both Kepler and Spitzer have their orbits around the Sun and how close to Earth they are, though the perception of distances are a bit crude and for illustration purposes.

Now it's the opportunity for us to delve into the capabilities of reading in the other ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, explored in the previous post, ie, other ranges than the visible. That said, Spitzer was planned to be an infrared eye to the sky, so to say.  Spitzer is an amazing feat, it's been at the project's core to read out the infrared signals from outer space and that's a very difficult technical thing to do and it's difficult because machines generate heat.

Just for a brief idea, this difficulty is related to the noisy signal heat itself causes to the equipment readings.  The machine itself, under a certain way of viewing it, damages the quality of the incoming signal, so to say.  That's why it is and has been a great challenge to map out the sky in the infrared part of the spectrum.

As the alloted space for our post comes to its limit in size, we must mention we'll hopefully have new opportunities, in following posts, to take back both the subject of Kepler's and that of Spitzer's. Till then, take care and see you soon.
