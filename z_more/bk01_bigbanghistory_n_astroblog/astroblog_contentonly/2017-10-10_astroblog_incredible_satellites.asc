== In the age of incredible astro-observational satellites

Modern Astronomy is for sure one very area of scientific endeavor that baffles us with wonder. Since Galileo observations in his telescope, instrumentational Astronomy has gone a long way.

Astronomy is, as we know it, an observational science. In Astronomy, we cannot interfere with the experiment; in Astronomy, we can only "read" the information that the Universe out there sends us. This reading the Universe out there is carried out by received electromagnetic waves, the most important of which -- from a traditional historic perspective -- is light itself.

Light is master and king in this realm, but the electromagnetic spectrum can be further assessed by the technology we have today.  With the right instruments, we can design equipments that are capable of receiving electromagnetic waves in divers ranges of the spectrum, such as radio, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. Light sits itself in-between the infrared and the ultraviolet sprectral ranges.

Though we presume most of our readers are already acquainted with the existence of a range-based sprectrum, we would still like to illustrate it a bit further in the figure below. The illustration below shows the electromagnetic spectrum as a line segment, ranging from the shortest wavelengths of the gamma rays to the largest wavelengths of the radiowaves.

The Hubble Space Telescole, launched in 19xx, inaugurated a new era in astrophysical research and exploration. Hubble itself is an amazing feat and its output and results are of immense value to mankind or, at least, to scientific-oriented minds. Loads of important discoveries were made by HST and the knowledge humanity has accumulated by now is really wonderful and instructional. Of course, as a side note, the more we know the more we have doubts, but as the saying goes: it's one step at a time, kid.

For reasons that we intend to explore in future posts, scientists have pushed ahead for the opportunity to also read the Universe in the other ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum than the visible.

We will take this subject back in following posts, but for now we want to list the names given to important astro-observational satellites that have already been launched and have already given us important data.  So, here follows the proposed list in the table below:
