# 01 Up Until Now

Philosophers usually top rank three problems in Philosophy as the greatest ones in order. The philosophical touch-stone that we are taught at school, the one that says Philosophy main quest is to find out from where we have come and to where we will go and ultimately what we are, that one great question is not topped up in the the three greatest.  The three greatest are the following:

1) the problem of knowledge;
2) the problem of how one should live his or here life individually and
3) the problem of how we, everyone, should live their lives collectively, ie, how we should live one with the other in society.
